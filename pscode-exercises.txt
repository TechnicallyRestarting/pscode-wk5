// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if "Odd" print 
 "Odd Number"

Else print even

Check each number
If number is odd 'print' odd
If number is even 'print' even



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    


a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A) I have picked to 'read in' numbers 1,2,3,4,5
B) 1+2+3+4+5 / 5 = b  Add together all numbers and divide by 5 Average=2.4
C) Order numbers smallest to largest. Print 1st number as 'minimum'. Print last number as maximum. 
D) Average of the 5 numbers is 2.4 The answer for C is 'minimum' = 1 'maximum' = 2
